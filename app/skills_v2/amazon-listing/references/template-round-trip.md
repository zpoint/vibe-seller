# Listing template round trip — download → inspect → fill → upload → feedback

> **Load this for any listing CRUD.** The flat-file template is
> category-specific: the column set and valid values differ per product
> type, so `inspect` a fresh template before filling it.

## 0. The template geometry (two dialects — auto-detected)

Amazon ships **two** flat-file templates and `listing_bulk.py` handles
both; `inspect` prints which (`dialect: legacy` / `dialect: unified`).

**legacy (`TemplateType=fptcustom`)** — the classic flat file, a
three-row header:

```
Excel row 1   TemplateType=fptcustom | Version | Signature | group names
Excel row 2   Local Label Names   (LOCALISED — e.g. "Seller SKU")
Excel row 3   field API names     (item_sku, update_delete, ...)  <-- keyed
Excel row 4+  data rows
```

**unified (NGS "Beta Product Spreadsheet")** — the current Seller Central
template, a five-row header and PREFILLED example rows:

```
Excel row 1   settings=feedType=…&labelRow=4&attributeRow=5&dataRow=8…  (signature blob)
Excel row 2   instructions ("Use ENGLISH … do not delete the colored head")
Excel row 3   group names (Listing Identity | Variations | …)
Excel row 4   Local Label Names   (LOCALISED)
Excel row 5   field API names     <-- keyed
Excel row 6-7 PREFILLED example SKU + a "do not delete this row" instruction
Excel row 8+  where the UI expects your data
```

Every field name in the unified dialect is **decorated**: the SKU is
`contribution_sku#1.value`, the operation is `::record_action` (tokens
`Create or Replace (Full Update)` / `Edit (Partial Update)` / `Delete`),
parentage is `parentage_level[marketplace_id=<id>]#1.value`, the parent
link is `child_parent_sku_relationship[marketplace_id=<id>]#1.parent_sku`,
the theme is `variation_theme#1.name`, the brand/title are
`…[marketplace_id=<id>][language_tag=<tag>]#1.value`, the product id is
`amzn1.volt.ca.product_id{_type,_value}`, and the offer price carries an
`[audience=ALL]` insert
(`purchasable_offer[marketplace_id=<id>][audience=ALL]#1.our_price…`).

`listing_bulk.py` locates the field-name row **structurally** (the row
carrying the SKU column — `item_sku` OR `contribution_sku`) and resolves
every friendly role from the header, so the **same spec drives either
dialect** — never key on a fixed row number or the localised label row.

> **`fill` clears the prefilled example/instruction rows for you.** The
> unified template ships an example SKU + a "do not delete this row"
> instruction in the data area. **Do NOT hand-roll the upload file** — a
> hand-rolled file that appends your SKUs *after* those rows uploads the
> example + instruction as if they were real SKUs (a live run got
> **"1/8 successful"** that way: only the parent created, the junk rows
> and the children failed). `fill` deletes everything below the field-name
> row before writing, so only your SKUs ship.

The metadata sheets are the source of truth:

- **`Data Definitions`** — one row per field with `Required?`.
- **`Valid Values`** / **`Dropdown Lists`** — the accepted enum tokens
  (e.g. `variation_theme` ∈ {Color, color-size, Size, …}).
- **`Browse data`** — the valid `recommended_browse_nodes` for the
  category (a gated set; a guessed node id is rejected).

## 1. Download the template

Seller Central → **Catalogue → Add Products via Upload**
(`sellercentral.amazon.<tld>/listing/upload` → `/product-search/bulk`).
Open **Spreadsheet → Download Blank Template → Download Product
Spreadsheet**, search the product type (e.g. "socks" → **Select**
"Sock"), choose the language, then **just make sure your TARGET
marketplace's checkbox is ticked** (it usually is by default) and
**Generate Spreadsheet**. The file lands in `~/.vibe-seller/downloads/<slug>/`
(a macro-enabled `.xlsm`).

> **Do NOT try to uncheck the other marketplaces.** A bundled
> multi-marketplace template (e.g. SA + AE) is perfectly fine — `fill`
> routes the offer AND the quantity to your target marketplace's block
> (see the per-marketplace offer/stock rule below), so extra marketplaces
> in the template are harmless. Fighting the store `kat-checkbox`es wastes
> the run: their state doesn't reliably toggle via `click_at_xy`/JS, and
> the whole point (single-marketplace) buys you nothing. Leave them as-is
> and Generate.
>
> **Coordinate gotcha after a viewport resize:** if you used
> `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` (below-fold recipe) to reach the
> Generate button, every element's `getBoundingClientRect` is now in the
> NEW tall viewport — **re-read the coordinates after the override**
> before `click_at_xy`; the pre-resize x/y are stale.

> **The "Generate Spreadsheet" button is usually BELOW the fold** (it sits
> at the bottom of a tall `kat-popover`, and the Ziniao window is only
> ~839px tall — `scrollIntoView`/`scrollTo` can't bring it up, so a normal
> `click_at_xy` can't reach it). Don't reuse a stale template to dodge
> this. Grow the viewport with CDP, then click: see browser-harness
> **"A control BELOW the fold that won't scroll into view"** —
> `cdp("Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride", width=1920, height=2400,
> deviceScaleFactor=1, mobile=False)`, `click_at_xy` the button's
> `getBoundingClientRect` centre, poll the downloads dir for the new
> `.xlsm`, then `cdp("Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride")`.

> **Getting TO the product-type search (verified 2026-07, NGS beta).**
> On `/product-search/bulk` a right-side **"Choose a template"** panel

>
> **Product-Type search — it's a PLAIN `<input>` + a separate search-icon

> click_at_xy(box["x"], box["y"])                 # focus the input
> cdp("Input.insertText", text="socks")           # TRUSTED typing (value= / events don't stick)
> time.sleep(1)
> # click the search-icon button just right of the input (find it by position),

>   .filter(function(e){return e.x>0;});"""))   # → click the search icon, then Select
> PY
> ```
> After **Select**, the right column shows "Product Type Selected: Sock".
> Then tick the store(s) (the account's home marketplace may be force-
> checked; ensure the marketplace you're listing on is ticked), and click
> **Generate Spreadsheet** — which is below the fold, so use the CDP
> viewport-resize recipe above. A fresh `.xlsm` lands in the downloads dir
> within ~30s. (`cdp("Input.insertText", ...)` needs the element focused

## 2. Inspect

```bash
$PY $S/listing_bulk.py inspect ~/.vibe-seller/downloads/<slug>/TEMPLATE.xlsm
# one field's detail (columns / required / accepted values):
$PY $S/listing_bulk.py inspect TEMPLATE.xlsm --field variation_theme
```

Read off: the total/required field counts, the operation column, the
variation cluster (`parent_child`, `relationship_type`,
`variation_theme`, `parent_sku`, `external_product_id[_type]`), and the
required fields with their enums. `brand_name`'s valid values reveal
the account's **registered brand** — a create must use it (brand-gated).

## 3. The spec (parent + children)

`fill` takes a JSON spec. Top-level `product_type` and `brand` are
defaults applied to every row. Each row has `sku`, `operation`, and a
`fields` map keyed by **field API name**; the friendly keys `parentage`,
`parent_sku`, `variation_theme`, and `asin` fold into their flat-file
fields.

```json
{
  "product_type": "socks",
  "brand": "ACME",
  "marketplace": "SA",
  "rows": [
    { "sku": "WIDGET-001", "operation": "create", "parentage": "Parent",
      "variation_theme": "Color",
      "fields": { "relationship_type": "Variation",
                  "item_name": "ACME ...", "product_description": "...",
                  "recommended_browse_nodes": "<from Valid Values>",
                  "target_gender": "Male", "department_name": "mens",
                  "batteries_required": "No", "are_batteries_included": "No" } },
    { "sku": "WIDGET-001-WHT", "operation": "create", "parentage": "Child",
      "parent_sku": "WIDGET-001", "variation_theme": "Color",
      "fields": { "relationship_type": "Variation", "color_name": "White",
                  "item_name": "ACME ... (White)", "target_gender": "Male",
                  "age_range_description": "Adult",
                  "recommended_browse_nodes": "<from Browse data>",
                  "fulfillment_availability#1.fulfillment_channel_code": "DEFAULT",
                  "quantity": "100",
                  "our_price": "29.00" } }
  ]
}
```

> **Set the offer price with the bare `our_price` key + a top-level
> `marketplace` (the country you are listing on, matching the
> seller-central domain — `amazon.sa` → `"SA"`).** `fill` routes the
> price into `purchasable_offer[marketplace_id=<that marketplace>]` for
> you. Do NOT hand-pick a `purchasable_offer[marketplace_id=…]` column:
> a multi-marketplace template marks a *different* marketplace's block
> Required (the account's home marketplace), and a price in the wrong
> block creates an **ASIN with no live offer** — the listing sits in
> **"Missing offer"** and never goes live, even though the feed reports
> success. (Pass `--marketplace SA` to `fill` as an alternative to the
> top-level key.) Any Amazon country code works (`US`, `UK`, `DE`, `JP`,
> `AE`, `SA`, …); a raw marketplace id is also accepted. If you omit
> `marketplace` entirely and the template has offer columns for exactly
> one marketplace, `fill` auto-detects it from the template — so a
> marketplace not in the built-in table still works. Omit `main_image_url`
> when the only image you have is a
> hotlinked supplier URL. Give each child its category's full required
> set, not just the differentiator (see the Parent-vs-Child note below).

> **Apparel (socks, clothing, …) — the full `apparel_size` composite is
> required on EVERY row, parent included.** Verified live: a socks
> variation only goes live when each row (parent + children) carries the
> WHOLE size composite — `apparel_size_system`, `apparel_size_class`,
> `apparel_size`, `apparel_body_type`, `apparel_height_type` — each a
> valid enum from the template (e.g. system `UAE/KSA`, class `Alpha`,
> size `One Size`, body/height `Regular`). Miss any one and the report
> says *"the field 'height_type'/'body_type' for attribute 'Apparel Size'
> does not have enough values"* (parent) or *"A value is required for
> apparel_body_type"* (child) — and nothing goes live. `fill` auto-adds
> `relationship_type: Variation` to every variation row (a child without
> it errors `relationship_type = null` and never creates), so you don't
> hand-write it. **A brand-new variation family often needs two passes:**
> the parent creates first; the children attach on a re-upload. The feed
> "N/N successful" count is NOT liveness — always confirm on **Manage
> Inventory** that the parent shows **Variations (N)** and each child has
> a real ASIN. Read the processing report by opening **Check Upload
> Status**, screenshotting to find your batch's **Download Processing
> Summary** button, then `parse-feedback` (it reads the cell-comment
> errors).

### Parent vs Child — what goes where

- **Parent** row: shared catalogue data only (product type, brand,
  title, description, `parent_child: Parent`, `relationship_type:
  Variation`, `variation_theme`). It carries **no** offer, stock,
  images, colour/size, or product-id — those are child-level.
- **Child** rows: `parent_child: Child`, `parent_sku` = the parent's
  SKU, the differentiating attribute (`color_name` / `size_name`), plus
  the **stock** (bare `quantity` — `fill` routes it to the marketplace's
  own `fulfillment_availability#N` group) and **price** (bare `our_price`
  → `purchasable_offer[marketplace_id=…]#1.our_price#1.schedule#1.value_with_tax`,
  one block per target marketplace).

`fill` knows this: it suppresses child-level required-field warnings on
a Parent row, and suppresses battery/hazmat required-field warnings when
the row declares no batteries.

> **Children are NOT minimal — fill each child's full required set.**
> On a real socks create, minimal children (only `parent_sku` + colour +
> offer) were rejected: Amazon required `item_name`, `target_gender`,
> `age_range_description`, `apparel_size_system`, and the compound
> `apparel_body_type` / `apparel_height_type` **on every child row**. So
> put the shared required attributes on the children too, not just the
> parent. `fill`'s "missing required field(s)" warnings on child rows
> are worth heeding, but the authoritative list is what the **processing
> report** flags per SKU — read it and add exactly those fields.
> `external_product_id` is the exception: a **GTIN-exempt** brand leaves
> it blank (set `brand_name`); the feed may still print an `8560` on
> children, yet the ASINs create under the exemption — verify in
> inventory, not the feed count.

### The operation column

`operation` maps to the `update_delete` cell: `create`→blank,
`update`→`Update`, `partialupdate`→`partialupdate`, `delete`→`delete`.
A **delete** row needs only `sku` + `operation: delete`. **Changing a
parent-child relationship** is an update: re-submit the child with the
new `parent_sku` / `variation_theme` (or clear `parent_sku` and set
`parent_child` appropriately to detach).

> **Deleting a variation family — first ENUMERATE every SKU (don't guess).**
> You usually know only the parent SKU (or its title). Do NOT try to
> expand the parent's "Variations (N)" in Manage Inventory to read the
> child SKUs — the New-Seller-Central inventory grid is a **virtualized
> table** whose child rows aren't reachable from the DOM, and it will
> waste the whole run. Instead get the authoritative SKU list from a
> **fresh All Listings Report**: Seller Central → **Reports → Inventory
> Reports → All Listings Report → Request** (a few min), then download the
> TSV to `~/.vibe-seller/downloads/<slug>/`. It lists **every** SKU
> (parent + children) with `seller-sku`, `asin`, and the parent linkage.
> Grep the family (by your SKU prefix, or the parent ASIN),
> collect all its SKUs, then delete: a spec with `operation: delete` for
> **each CHILD first, then the parent** (a parent can't delete while it
> still has live children). Upload the `.txt`, then verify each SKU is
> gone (its `skucentral?mSku=<sku>` **redirects** to /myinventory instead
> of staying). Never rely on a local spec/file from the create step — a
> delete task is independent and must discover SKUs from the account.

```bash
$PY $S/listing_bulk.py fill TEMPLATE.xlsm --spec SPEC.json --out /tmp/<slug>/out.xlsm
```

`fill` prints a warning (never fails) for an enum value not in the
template's valid list, a missing required field, or a field absent from
this template — so an unseen-but-valid token from a new category still
uploads. Read the warnings; they are the same errors Amazon would
reject on.

## 4. Upload the `.txt` + read the processing report

**Upload the tab-delimited `.txt` that `fill` wrote, NOT the `.xlsm`.**
An openpyxl-saved `.xlsm` is rejected with a **90502 FATAL** ("the file
does not contain a worksheet with a template type that is supported for
Excel upload") — the re-save alters the macro-workbook structure Amazon
validates, and its own remedy is to upload a tab-delimited text file.
The `.txt` reaches real content validation, which is what you want.

On the upload page the file input is a `kat-file-upload` widget. Its
`shadowRoot input#kat-file-attachment` is an **inert placeholder** — a
`DOM.setFileInputFiles` on it returns success but leaves `files.length`
at **0** (verified: objectId, `backendNodeId`, and `getDocument(pierce)`
all no-op), so DON'T set that node and DON'T click "Browse"/`file://`.

The widget creates its **real** input only when the "Upload file" button
is clicked with a **trusted** gesture, and hands it to you via
`Page.fileChooserOpened`. Intercept the chooser, trusted-click the button,
set the file on that `backendNodeId` (`cdp()` params are keyword args):

```bash
browser-use <<'PY'
import time
cdp('Page.enable'); cdp('Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog', enabled=True)
drain_events()
box = js("""var b=document.querySelector('kat-file-upload').shadowRoot.querySelector('#select-file');
            var r=b.getBoundingClientRect();
            return {x:Math.round(r.x+r.width/2), y:Math.round(r.y+r.height/2)};""")
click_at_xy(box['x'], box['y'])          # TRUSTED click (not JS .click())
bnid = None
for _ in range(8):
    time.sleep(0.5)
    for e in drain_events():
        if 'fileChooserOpened' in str(e.get('method','')): bnid = e['params']['backendNodeId']
    if bnid: break
cdp('DOM.setFileInputFiles', backendNodeId=bnid, files=['/tmp/<slug>/listing.txt'])
cdp('Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog', enabled=False)
print('attached to', bnid)
PY
```

(Generic recipe + the plain-input Method 1: `browser-harness` SKILL.md §
"Uploading a file".)

> **Submit is a TWO-CLICK flow — the first click only introspects.** On
> the unified upload page (`/product-search/bulk`) clicking **Submit
> products** the first time fires `listing/introspect-feed` (file-type

> → click Submit again → confirm the URL carries `reference_id=`.
>
> **The red "Sorry! There's a network error. Try again later." banner is a

After the second click Amazon processes asynchronously; the batch row on
**Check Upload Status** (`/listing/status`) shows `SKUs successful /
submitted` and a **Download Processing Summary** link. Save it and parse
it:

```bash
$PY $S/listing_bulk.py parse-feedback /tmp/<slug>/processing-summary.xlsm
```

It prints per-SKU `[Error|Warning] sku=… code=…: message`. Fix the
flagged fields and re-upload.

> **"Parent created, children N/A" (e.g. `1/8`) is a CONTENT rejection of
> the children — NOT a browser/upload glitch.** If the batch shows a

> brand-new variation family also often needs a second pass: the parent
> creates first, the children attach on re-upload — so re-upload the
> children once with a clean `fill`ed file before assuming a data error.)

**Done = the family is in inventory, not "0 errors".** Verify on Manage
Inventory (or `skucentral?mSku=<sku>` **without** `&condition=New`):
each SKU has an ASIN and the parent shows **"Variations (N)"**. The feed
count under-reports — records with errors still create stubs, and later
re-uploads can complete them.

### First-upload gotchas (verified on a socks template — priors, not a checklist)

- **`recommended_browse_nodes`** is a **gated set** per category — a
  guessed id is rejected. Pick one from the template's `Browse data`
  sheet. Put it on **every** row (parent + children).
- **Enum case is exact** (`apparel_size_system` = `UAE/KSA`, not
  `uae/ksa`). `fill` canonicalises to the template's casing, but if you
  hand-edit, match the Valid Values sheet exactly.
- **Compound attributes arrive as a set.** Apparel Size needs
  `apparel_size_class` + `apparel_size_system` + `apparel_body_type` +
  `apparel_height_type` together — a partial set errors 99001/99022.
- **`8560` on a buyable child ("doesn't match any ASINs … include
  standard_product_id")** — Amazon won't mint a new ASIN. Decide by
  whether that child's ASIN already exists:
  - **Exists** (re-submit, or a prior create left a catalog ASIN — a
    `delete` removes the SKU/offer, **not** the catalog ASIN): **match**
    it — `operation: update`, `external_product_id` = the ASIN,
    `external_product_id_type: asin`. This is what lets a stuck variation
    child join its family (verified fix).
  - **Genuinely new, GTIN-exempt brand:** leave `external_product_id`
    blank + set `brand_name`, and fill the **key defining attributes the
    report names as missing** (e.g. `material_type`, `pattern_name`) so
    the ASIN can be minted. The exemption alone is not enough. Exemptions
    are per brand+category+**marketplace**.
  Set `update_delete` on every row, children included.
- **Offer/price is per-marketplace; verify in that marketplace's Pricing
  view.** Fill one offer block —
  `purchasable_offer[marketplace_id=<MKT>]#1.our_price#1.schedule#1.value_with_tax`
  (`our_price` is the only price column that matters) + a bare `quantity`
  for stock. **Stock is per-marketplace but NOT bracketed** — each
  `fulfillment_availability#N` group is tied by *position* to one
  marketplace's offer block, so don't hand-pick `#1`; use bare `quantity`
  and `fill` routes it to the group adjacent to the target offer. The feed
  count doesn't reflect price; quantity can apply while Pricing shows `--`
  if you set a different marketplace's column. On a bundled
  multi-marketplace template, fill only the intended marketplace's block.
- **`main_image_url`:** by default not uploaded here (seller adds images)
  — a `18320` image error is *expected*, not a blocker. Never hotlink a
  supplier CDN URL (1688/alibaba `cbu01.alicdn.com`, tmall) — Amazon
  can't fetch a referer-protected image, so the listing is suppressed.
- Many **battery / lithium / hazmat** fields are marked Required but are
  only *conditionally* required — leave them blank for a non-battery
  product (set `batteries_required: No`, `are_batteries_included: No`).
