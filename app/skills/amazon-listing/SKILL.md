# Amazon — Listing CRUD (flat-file upload)

> **PREREQUISITE:** read `../amazon-shared/SKILL.md` for login, Ziniao
> auto-fill / OTP, marketplace TLDs, hamburger navigation, and the
> capture rule (live data → `/tmp/<task>/`, never `knowledge/`).

Amazon's **Add Products via Upload** takes a category **flat-file
template** — a macro-enabled `.xlsm` whose `Template` sheet is a wide
table (one column per attribute). One upload creates or edits a whole
**variation family** (a Parent plus N colour/size Children) at once.
This is the batch equivalent of the per-SKU web wizard, and the default
for anything touching more than one variant.

Two references, load what the task needs:

- **`references/template-round-trip.md`** — the download → inspect →
  fill → upload → read-feedback loop, the operation column
  (create/update/partialupdate/delete), and the parent-child cluster.
  Load for **any** listing CRUD.
- **`references/1688-sourcing.md`** — turning a supplier link into a
  filled template: page extraction, local no-GPU OCR of detail images,
  AI-generated copy, the **bilingual review** step, and image handling.
  Load when the task starts from a **product link**.

## Work it like a human: upload → read the report → fix → repeat

The template, its required fields, valid values, and even the upload
mechanics **change per product type and over time**. Do not follow a
fixed recipe from memory. Run the loop a human runs:

1. **Download a FRESH template** for the exact product type — Amazon's
   own error messages say "download the latest template". Never reuse a
   stale one.
2. **`inspect` it.** The field set / required fields / valid values for
   THIS category are the ground truth, not this doc.
3. **Fill, upload, then download the processing report.** Read the
   per-SKU error for **each** row (errors live in cell comments on the
   report's `Template` tab, keyed by field — `parse-feedback` extracts
   them).
4. **For each error: reason about it, search the error code/message if
   unfamiliar, fix that one field, re-upload.**
5. **Repeat until the listing APPEARS IN INVENTORY** — that, not the
   feed's "N/N successful" count, is done.

The fixes listed below are **examples this loop surfaced on real
templates** — priors that speed up diagnosis, not a checklist that
replaces reading the actual report.

### Verification: trust inventory, not the feed count

The report's "records processed / 0 errors" means the **feed was
accepted**, not that a live listing exists. A record *with* errors can
still create an incomplete stub; a clean feed can leave a suppressed
listing. **Always confirm on Manage Inventory** (or
`skucentral?mSku=<sku>` **without** `&condition=New` — that param
false-negates incomplete listings). Confirm the SKU has an ASIN, and for
a family that the parent shows **"Variations (N)"**.

### Priors that recur across categories

- **Upload a tab-delimited `.txt`, not the `.xlsm`.** `fill` writes the
  `.txt` next to the `.xlsm` for you — upload that. An openpyxl-saved
  `.xlsm` triggers a **90502 FATAL** ("worksheet template type not
  supported for Excel upload").
- **Children are NOT minimal.** Each child needs the full required set
  its category asks for (e.g. `item_name`, `target_gender`,
  `age_range_description`, and any compound-attribute sub-fields), plus
  its differentiator + offer — not just `parent_sku` + colour.
- **Enum case is exact** (`UAE/KSA`, not `uae/ksa`). `fill` canonicalises
  a value to the template's own casing when the field has a valid set.
- **Compound attributes come as a set** — e.g. Apparel Size needs
  `apparel_size_class` + `apparel_size_system` + `apparel_body_type` +
  `apparel_height_type` together; a partial set errors (99001/99022).
- **Own-country only** — in the generator, select the store's **single**
  marketplace (multi-marketplace disables Listing Preferences and adds
  offer blocks you don't need). Fill only that marketplace's offer.
- **Don't hotlink a supplier image URL** into `main_image_url` — Amazon
  can't fetch a referer-protected 1688/alibaba CDN URL, so the listing
  is created but suppressed. Leave it blank (listing lands as "needs
  image") and add images via the proper image flow.
- **GTIN-exempt brand** — leave `external_product_id` blank and set
  `brand_name`; the feed may report an `8560` on children, but the ASINs
  still create under the brand exemption. Verify in inventory, not the
  feed count.

## The two scripts

```bash
S=<skills>/amazon-listing/scripts
PY=<project-venv>/bin/python3     # needs openpyxl + rapidocr-onnxruntime
```

- **`listing_bulk.py`** — deterministic template writer. It keys every
  field by its **field API name** (the row that contains `item_sku`),
  which is identical in every console language, so it is locale-robust
  the same way `amazon-ads/ads_bulk.py` is.
  - `inspect TEMPLATE.xlsm [--field NAME]` — dump the field set, which
    fields are Required, the accepted enum tokens, and the variation
    cluster. **Run this first on every fresh template** — the column
    set and valid values differ per product type.
  - `fill TEMPLATE.xlsm --spec SPEC.json --out OUT.xlsm` — write
    parent/child rows, set the operation column per row, validate enums
    and required fields against the template's own metadata sheets, and
    preserve the workbook (macros, signature row) verbatim.
  - `parse-feedback REPORT` — summarise Amazon's processing report into
    per-SKU errors / warnings.
- **`ocr_1688.py`** — local, GPU-free OCR (rapidocr-onnxruntime) of the
  supplier's detail images, where the spec table / size chart live.

## Operation rules (the in-sheet `update_delete` column)

The operation is **chosen per row in the sheet**, not inferred:

| `operation` in spec | `update_delete` cell | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `create` (default) | *blank* | new SKU. **No ASIN** → this is the default. |
| `update` | `Update` | full re-submit of an existing SKU's attributes. |
| `partialupdate` | `partialupdate` | change only the fields present; leave others as-is. |
| `delete` | `delete` | remove the SKU. Needs only `sku` + `operation`. |

Rule of thumb the user gave: **no ASIN filled → create; ASIN filled →
update** — but the sheet's operation column is authoritative, so always
set `operation` explicitly. For update/partialupdate by ASIN, put the
ASIN in `external_product_id` with `external_product_id_type: asin`.

## End-to-end flow (product link → live listing)

1. **Extract** the product from the supplier link (see
   `1688-sourcing.md`): page data + OCR of detail images.
2. **Generate** an Amazon title, 5 bullet points, and a long
   description from the extracted data.
3. **Bilingual review** — present the generated copy to the user in
   **both the user's language and the target marketplace language**,
   plus the **proposed parent-child structure** (which variation theme,
   which children). Wait for the user's confirmation / edits. This is
   the one genuinely interactive step; do not skip it.
4. **Download** the category template for the product type (into
   `~/.vibe-seller/downloads/<slug>/`), `inspect` it.
5. **Fill** a spec (parent + children) and produce the `.xlsm`.
6. **Upload** it and **read the processing report**; fix row-level
   errors from the report and re-upload. Common first-timers: an
   invalid `recommended_browse_nodes` (pick from the template's valid
   values) and a missing `external_product_id` (own-brand items need a
   real barcode or a **GTIN exemption**).

## Sourcing login

The supplier site (1688) needs a login for some bulk specs, but the
core product data is reachable without it. When a login **is** needed,
the login is a QR scan — **ask the user to scan it** (do not attempt to
authenticate on their behalf). Say which QR and wait.
