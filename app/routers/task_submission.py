"""Submission and verdict — the two halves of ``set_task_result``.

A reviewer gate refuses by raising, and the raise used to happen before
``task.result`` was assigned, so a refusal DESTROYED the submission: N
refusals left the run holding nothing and the end-of-turn fallback had
only chat prose to offer. What the agent submitted and what the review
said about it are separate facts, recorded separately here, and only a
submission that clears every gate becomes ``accepted_result``.

Split out of ``routers/tasks.py`` (over the per-file line limit) as one
cohesive unit rather than by cutting lines to fit.
